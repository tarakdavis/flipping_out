# flipping_outll of the following will be done in a Jupyter Notebook. Put the necessary imports in the topmost cell(s) of the Notebook, and each task involving code or analysis will be done in its own discrete cell.

Create a function to flip a coin. It is up to you to determine what this returns to signify heads or tails.

Then create a function to run a simulation of flipping a coin n number of times, default 216, recording how many heads and tails it has at different intervals. The intervals are exponential, so record at 20, 21, 22, and so on until you reach n. Record the final number as well.

Then make a line plot of the difference between heads and tails at each recorded point, and another with the ratio of heads to tails at each recorded point.

Create these plots again, but as scatter plots with a logarithmic scale for the x-axis.

Write notes about what you observe. Feel free to add more plots to help you.

Now we will look at the mean and standard deviation of these trials of flipping coins. Flip coins as before, but run 20 trials of 216 each.

Create a scatter plot of the mean heads/tails ratio at each recorded point, and another scatter plot to plot the standard deviation of the heads/tails ratio at each recorded point. You will want to use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis in both. You may want to do the same for the y-axis with the standard deviation.
